# simple_drf_auth_example
This is a simple django project with token based authenticated using Rest Framework  

### had to mention  
well i wrote this example only for those who new to this and want to see a expandable and yet simple approach.  
be aware of its cons. 
you better use django standard login view as Rest-framework docs suggusted  
this code is my trying to understand the logic of creating and assigning tokens to users

any suggustions about improving this code ( simplicity-wise ) will be considered
